- Fixed a few config options having improper sync destinations on 1.21.5.
- Fixed snowlogged rendering with Sodium on 1.21.5.
- Updated how rendering of Snowlogged blocks is handled.
- Updated how Wilder Wild detects if the `MC Live Tendrils` internal resource pack is enabled, no longer relying on an empty texture being loaded.
