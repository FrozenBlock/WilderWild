Please clear changelog after each release.
Put the changelog BELOW the dashes. ANYTHING ABOVE IS IGNORED.
-----------------
- Added a config option to grant players extended reach while holding a Crab Claw in either hand.
  - This is off by default, but can be changed in-game on-the-fly via the config.
  - The on-the-fly config functionality may not work on 1.21.2+, hence the restart prompt appearing when changing this config value.
- Fixed Jungle Logs turning into Oak Logs when hollowed. ([#516](https://github.com/FrozenBlock/WilderWild/issues/516))
- Fixed a feature cycle order crash with `Oh The Biomes We've Gone`. ([#518](https://github.com/FrozenBlock/WilderWild/issues/518))
- Updated the Ukranian translations, thanks to StarmanMine142! ([#514](https://github.com/FrozenBlock/WilderWild/pull/514))
