hi
-----------------
- Added Biolith integration, thanks to Rebel459! ([#463](https://github.com/FrozenBlock/WilderWild/pull/463))
- Fixed many of Wilder Wild's features not generating, or generating in unintended ways.
  - This primarily impacted surface transition features, which would not generate at all.
- Fixed Chest Boats and Rafts crashing on 1.21.2+.
- Termite Mounds, Display Lanterns, and Sculk Sensors now sync their data to the client more similarly to Vanilla's method of doing so.
- Fixed Firefly and Butterfly Bottles playing the release sound using the incorrect sound category.
- Removed the `echo_glass` mixin package and merged its contents into existing mixins in the `block_break` mixin package.
