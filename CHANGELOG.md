-----------------
- Added a title screen version of `Espial` by `pictochats_`!
- Added the song `Anemone` by `pictochats_`!
- Added the `wilderwild:music_pool/has_ocean_music` and `wilderwild:music_pool/has_warm_ocean_music` biome tags.
  - The music that plays in Ocean biomes contains the `minecraft:music.game` pool like it did before, now with `Anemone` and `Epsial` by `pictochats_` having a chance to play as well.
  - `Anemone` by `pictochats_` plays most commonly in warmer Ocean biomes.
  - `Espial` by `pictochats` plays most commonly in all other Ocean biomes.
  - Added a config option to toggle Wilder Wild's Ocean music.
- Removed the songs `Excuse` and `Flake` by `C418` as obfuscated ogg files no longer work in Minecraft.
- Fixed Doors not using the proper item class.
- Jellyfish and Butterflies have had their spawning logic vastly simplified, now using Vanilla's Spawn Charge/Cost system.
  - As a result of this change, the following changes have been made:
    - The `wilderwild:entity/spawn/jellyfish` biome tag now dictates all biomes Jellyfish can spawn in.
    - The `wilderwild:entity/spawn/jellyfish_special_spawn` biome tag has been replaced with the `wilderwild:entity/spawn/jellyfish_common_spawn` biome tag.
      - This tag now dictates which biomes (of the ones they can spawn in) Jellyfish can spawn more frequently and closer together in.
    - The `wilderwild:entity/spawn/butterfly` biome tag now dictates all biomes Butterflies can spawn in.
    - The `wilderwild:entity/spawn/common_butterfly` biome tag has been replaced with the `wilderwild:entity/spawn/butterfly_common_spawn` biome tag.
      - This tag now dictates which biomes (of the ones they can spawn in) Butterflies can spawn more frequently and closer together in.
- Renamed the `wilderwild:feature/red_creeping_moss_feature_placeable` block tag to `wilderwild:feature/auburn_creeping_moss_feature_placeable`.
- Auburn Creeping Moss generated in Auburn Moss patches can now generate on the sides of blocks.
- Fixed the Bush not datafixing into the Shrub in 1.21.5+ due to an incorrect DataVersion.
- Fixed Maple Leaf Litters not generating as intended.
- Fixed the Leaf Litter model being raised too high above the ground on versions prior to 1.21.5.
- Misc. internal cleanup.
