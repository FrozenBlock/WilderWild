Please clear changelog after each release.
Put the changelog BELOW the dashes. ANYTHING ABOVE IS IGNORED.
-----------------
- Bumped Wilder Wild's protocol version to 17.
- Added a config option to grant players extended reach while holding a Crab Claw in either hand.
  - This is off by default, but can be changed in-game on-the-fly via the config.
  - The on-the-fly config functionality may not work on 1.21.2+, hence the restart prompt appearing when changing this config value.
- Fireflies can now be dyed in-world by clicking them with a Dye item.
- Cattails now generate closer together, and generate more Cattails per-patch on average.
- Cattail patches can that generate on Mud when not near water have been removed.
- Milkweed now generate more commonly in Swamps and Mangrove Swamps.
- Butterflies now rarely spawn in Swamps.
- Moobloom parents of the same flower color no longer attempt to produce offspring with a "mixed" color.
  - This was unintentional behavior, and allowed players to obtain Mooblooms of the same color but different flowers.
- Mooblooms can now properly render double-tall blocks.
  - A new `top_flower_block_state` field has been added for Moobloom variants.
    - This is an optional field, and is not present by default.
    - Takes a block state, just like the `flower_block_state` field.
    - When present, will render as the top-half of the block on Mooblooms.
    - Double-tall blocks will be scaled slightly smaller than single blocks on Mooblooms.
- Wind Particles can now spawn in clusters.
  - The more intense the wind, the higher the chance for Wind Particles to spawn near another Wind Particle!
  - This feature was added to make Wind Particles feel more like part of the game's ambience, opposed to one-off particles that randomly appear.
  - Added config options to control whether clusters can spawn, the max amount of Wind Particles per cluster, and the relative chance for a Wind Particle to spawn in a cluster.
- Updated the Old Growth Dark Forest.
  - The amount of trees has been drastically increased.
  - "Big Shrub/Bush" features generate more frequently.
  - Fallen Dark Oak Trees generate slightly more frequently.
  - Increased the amount of space Old Growth Dark Forests take up.
  - Beta Beaches can no longer generate in Old Growth Dark Forests.
- Fixed the Shrub's textures being flipped on its model.
- The Shrub's break particles now only use its leaves overlay, instead of its stem and branches.

  - `wilderwild:gameplay/plankton_glowing` dictates if Plankton will glow.
  - `wilderwild:gameplay/sea_anemone_glowing` dictates if Sea Anemone will glow.
- Added a new Timeline, `wilderwild:wilderwild_day`!
  - This Timeline controls Wilder Wild's three new Environment Attributes.
    - `wilderwild:gameplay/pale_mushroom_active`: True at nighttime and false in daytime.

### Tree Changes
- Hanging Coconuts now drop between 1-4 Coconuts when broken, opposed to 3-4.
- Changed the logic that determines whether a Cypress tree will grow into a unique Juniper shape or not.
  - Added the `wilderwild:cypress_grows_as_juniper_on` block tag.
    - Contains `#minecraft:sand` and `#minecraft:terracotta` by default.
  - A Cypress Sapling grown on top of a block within the `wilderwild:cypress_grows_as_juniper_on` block tag will assume the Juniper shape.
    - Before this change, the Juniper shape would be assumed only within Badlands biomes.
- Palm Trees can now only naturally generate a maximum of three Coconuts.
- Added the Yellow Maple Sapling, Orange Maple Sapling, and Red Maple Sapling.
  - This change was made due to community request and feedback, as having only one sapling which grants a random color was not preferred.
  - The original Maple Sapling will be datafixed into the Yellow Maple Sapling.
- The generation of Maple Trees has been completely overhauled, now sporting a much more natural shape.
  - This change was made after a long time due to community request and feedback, as the old Maple Tree generation did not fit well any other trees in Minecraft.
  - Added a config option to toggle the old shapes of Maple Tree trunks and foliage.
- Fallen Maple Trees now occasionally generate with branches.
- Added the `wilderwild:maple_trunk_placer` Trunk Placer, used for the new Maple Tree generation.
  - Contains both a `trunk_branch_placement` and `lower_trunk_branch_placement` field.
    - `lower_trunk_branch_placement` will be used if the current trunk position is less than half of the total trunk height.
  - The `alt_trunk_placer` field contains an alternate Trunk Placer, which will be used if the new Maple Tree generation is disabled.
- Renamed the old `wilderwild:maple_foliage_placer` Foliage Placer to `wilderwild:legacy_maple_foliage_placer`.
- Removed the `wilderwild:round_maple_foliage_placer` Foliage Placer.
- Added the `wilderwild:maple_foliage_placer` Foliage Placer, used for the new Maple Tree generation.
  - Generates much like Oak and Birch foliage but with hanging leaves on the bottom, similar to Cherry foliage.
  - The `hanging_leaves_chance` and `hanging_leaves_extension_chance` dictate the chances for hanging leaves blocks to generate, then to be extended upon generation respectively.
  - The `alt_foliage_placer` field contains an alternate Foliage Placer, which will be used if the new Maple Tree generation is disabled.
- The `foliage_radius_shrink` field of Wilder Wild's Trunk Branch Placement has been renamed to `foliage_radius_offset`, and now uses an Integer Provider instead of an Integer.
- The `offset_last_log_chance`, `minimum_branch_length_for_offset`, `foliage_placement_chance`, and `foliage_radius_offset` fields of Wilder Wild's Trunk Branch Placement are now all optional.
