- Fixed Chest Boats and Rafts crashing on 1.21.2+.
- Termite Mounds, Display Lanterns, and Sculk Sensors now sync their data to the client more similarly to Vanilla's method of doing so.
- Fixed Firefly and Butterfly Bottles playing the release sound using the incorrect sound category.
- Removed the `echo_glass` mixin package and merged its contents into existing mixins in the `block_break` mixin package.
