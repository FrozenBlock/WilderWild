-----------------
- Updated Vietnamese translations thanks to godkyo98! ([#478](https://github.com/FrozenBlock/WilderWild/pull/478) & [#479](https://github.com/FrozenBlock/WilderWild/pull/479))
- All Jellyfish entity textures are now 32x32 instead of 64x64, as the extra space was simply unneeded.
- Fixed Willow Boats not having translation strings for their entity counterparts on 1.21.2.
- Lowered the maximum height of Super Birch trees by 1.
- Added Xaero's Minimap icons for Wilder Wild's mobs, started off by godkyo98's work! ([#480](https://github.com/FrozenBlock/WilderWild/pull/480))
